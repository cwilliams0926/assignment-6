# assignment 6
A simple databinding application using .NET Core

# How it's made
**Tech Used**: C#, WinForms, .NET Core, Entity Framework, SQLite

I pretty much followed the exact steps as done in class and in the assignment itself. A person database is made using a code-first approach. WinForms is used to make all the controls. There is an interface for the data sources, allowing for dependency injection and the ability to switch easily between using a database to get our data or using an in-memory list.

# Lessons learned
This assignment helped me understand a code-first approach to databinding
